# Analyze accident data in Thailand using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) methods.
## The origin and significance
Road accidents in Thailand can occur anywhere, at any time, and involve people of all ages and genders. They can cause a great deal of property damage and casualties as well as economic system disruption. There are several elements that contribute to accidents. From what has been stated thus far, it appears that the publisher is interested in using exploratory data analysis to examine the relationships between the variables when analyzing road accident data in Thailand. The data will then be processed into easily readable graphs or other formats to provide readers with a summary of the findings.
## Objectives
- To analyze the relationship between various variables using the Exploratory data analysis method.
## The scope of the data
- Data about road accidents in Thailand in 2022 was sourced from [https://datagov.mot.go.th/](https://datagov.mot.go.th/dataset/roadaccident/resource/94b10b47-7bda-4f11-b6ce-e45c447c8dcd?inner_span=True&activity_id=aa76337a-1f33-407d-9f83-da3a9debc826)
- There are 37 columns and 21032 rows in the raw data that was used.
## Methodology of this project
1. Begin by performing data understanding and cleaning
  - ex. Handle missing values ​​by deleting or adding appropriate values.
2. When we have the information ready we must analyze to find in-depth information
  - ex. Relationships of variables, appearing patterns and calculation of statistics such as frequency, average, etc.
3. When we finished analyzing the data, it is important to make your data easy for others to understand. Data Visualization is to create various graphs or charts to make it easier for us to understand in-depth information. And you should choose a graph that is appropriate for the data set being analyzed.
  - ex. If you want to know what is the cause of most accidents. You should use bar graphs because bar graphs show the frequency of qualitative data.
